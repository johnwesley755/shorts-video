  "text": "The history of artificial intelligence dates back to ancient times when philosophers and mathematicians dreamed of machines that could think like humans. In the 1950s, the field of AI was formally established at a conference at Dartmouth College. Early AI systems were rule-based and could solve specific problems, but they lacked the ability to learn from experience. The 1980s saw the rise of expert systems, which could mimic human decision-making in specialized domains. After a period known as the \"AI winter\" when funding and interest declined, the field experienced a renaissance in the 2000s with the advent of machine learning and big data. Today, AI technologies like deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision are transforming industries from healthcare to transportation, creating both opportunities and challenges for society.",
